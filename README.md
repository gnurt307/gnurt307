### 👋 Hey there, I’m Trung!

By day: Project Officer at NTU Singapore  
By night: Bioinformatics explorer mapping the chaos of RNA and cancer biology 🧬💻

✨ I run wet labs.  
✨ I run scripts.  
✨ Sometimes they even run without errors.

Currently leveling up my computational skills while staying loyal to my trusty pipette.  
If you like multi-omics, RNA biology, or cool data visualizations — we’re already friends.
