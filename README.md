### 🧬 Hi, I'm Trung!

Currently a Project Officer at NTU Singapore, somewhere between:
- running bioinformatics pipelines 💻  
- running Western Blot 🧪  
- and running away from failed library preps 😅

I’m into cancer biology, RNA biology, alternative splicing, and anything that turns raw sequencing reads into scientific drama.  
Welcome to the chaos — feel free to explore my projects!
